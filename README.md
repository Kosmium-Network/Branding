Kosmium Network was founded back in 2021 by small group of friends, artists and cryptoenthusiasts who are evangelizing the Blockchain adoption, use cases and knowledge among other artists, collectors and more for a better adoption of blockchain technology. 

Kosmium Network creates the environment and raises awareness among artist, developers, and society by educating them in the blockchain space in general, and Multiverse× in particular.
We started with our first NFTs collection:  The Maiar Goddesses collection which is a very important one, because it marks the beginning of a long and successful road. After this initial first step, the others will follow. So join us on this journey and be part of the new WEB 3.0 that is open before us. Be part of something great. # Branding
